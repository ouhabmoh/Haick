Data Cleaning:

Data cleaning involves removing or correcting errors and inconsistencies in the data. This includes removing duplicates, handling missing values, and correcting data types.

Use case: Data cleaning is essential before performing any analysis or building any machine learning model.
Data Transformation:

Data transformation involves scaling, normalization, or log-transforming the data to make it more appropriate for analysis or modeling.

Use case: Data transformation can improve the performance of some machine learning algorithms and can make the data more interpretable.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

EDA involves visualizing and analyzing the data to gain insights about the relationships between the features and the target variable.

Use case: EDA is essential before building any machine learning model to understand the distribution and patterns in the data.
Feature Engineering:

Feature engineering involves creating new features or transforming existing features to improve the performance of machine learning models.

Use case: Feature engineering is often used to create more informative features from existing ones or to transform the data into a more meaningful representation.
Model Selection:

Model selection involves comparing the performance of different machine learning algorithms on the same dataset and selecting the best one.

Use case: Model selection is essential to choose the most appropriate algorithm for the given task.
Model Evaluation:

Model evaluation involves measuring the performance of a machine learning model on a test set or using cross-validation.

Use case: Model evaluation is used to estimate the performance of the model on new, unseen data.
Hyperparameter Tuning:

Hyperparameter tuning involves selecting the best set of hyperparameters for a machine learning algorithm.

Use case: Hyperparameter tuning is essential to optimize the performance of a machine learning model.
Data Preprocessing:

Data preprocessing involves preparing the data for analysis or modeling by performing techniques such as feature selection, handling imbalanced data, dimensionality reduction, and handling multicollinearity.

Use case: Data preprocessing can improve the performance of machine learning models and can make the data more interpretable.
